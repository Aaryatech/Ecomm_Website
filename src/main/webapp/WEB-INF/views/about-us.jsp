            <h2 class="new_title">Food Processing Sanitation/Hygiene</h2>
            <p>The philosophical viewpoint of the Food and Drug Administration is that they would prefer to see industries bring their    plants into compliance voluntarily rather than to force compliance through FDA action.</p>
            <p>The government rarely takes legal action against a processor without first making an inspection. The simplest examples are the finding of food products containing whole insects, very large fragments, whole rodent pellets or hairs, or in general, extraneous matter characterized by large size, indicating that the filth did not come from the raw ingredients.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="abt_one">
             <h2 class="new_title">Our standards</h2>
            <p>We are a HACCP &amp; ISO : 22000 certified company. We believe in ensuring the highest degree of sanitation and hygiene. We also follow Good Manufacturing practices levied by the AIB : The American Institute of Baking.</p>

            <p>We at Monginis take a moral responsibility of upholding all the Laws levied by the FDA. We believe in using the highest quality of raw materials and ingredients in our manufactured goods. We take pride in our processes which ensure consistency and ensure safety from hazardous mishaps.</p>
            <p> We believe in being honest and fair to all our stake holders. We strictly do not give credit nor encourage the idea of credit related transactions. Our company is a 100% interest free company. One of the very few companies in today’s times which could actually claim to be 100% interest free. We do not take interest not lend on interest.</p>

These federal guidelines state the legal criteria under which food can be processed and are enforced as law.</p>
            <p>The "Good Manufacturing Practices" implement the Congressional Statute; the FD&C Act. This set of guidelines outlines the types of actions that a food processor must take to manufacture food under clean conditions.</p>

            <p><span class="new_num">Section 110.10,</span> Personnel, states the wearing of insecure jewelry, including rings with stones, pendants, earrings, bobby pins, etc., by persons engaged in food processing is prohibited. This requirement helps protect the food from foreign material adulteration by these decorative materials. Provisions also include no eating, no tobacco use, or no drinking in production areas, as well as a prohibition against the storage of personal articles in the production areas.</p>
            
            <p><span class="new_num">Section 110.20,</span> Plant and Grounds, states that a food processor must take proper precautions to reduce the potential for contamination of end products, raw materials, or food packaging materials with microorganisms, chemicals, filth, or extraneous material. It requires that where the possibility of product adulteration exists, procedures must be developed to eliminate this potential contamination.</p>
            
            <p><span class="new_num">Section 110.35,</span> General Maintenance,requires that all poisonous and dangerous cleaning compounds, sanitizing agents, and pesticide chemicals shall be applied and stored so that food or food packaging material contamination is prevented.</p>
